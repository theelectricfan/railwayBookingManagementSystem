**1.1) Project Description:**
In this project of Railway Booking Management System, we will be
 implementing the ability to reserve and modify railway tickets. We will
use Linked List Operations, Searching & Sorting Algorithms to modify
and print the data according to user’s needs. This project is simple to
use and very user-friendly. It has minimal hardware and software
requirements, and no training is needed for using it. We have 2
modules in this scenario, where a user or the passenger, has their own
options while admin has to login separately before having their own
options. It works from the entering of user details, to payment, to
printing of tickets and other operations are available as well.

**1.2) Project Scope:**

The scope of this project is to help a user reserve and modify their
tickets without any hassle. This program will allow a user to reserve a
ticket, edit their personal details, ask for a refund or cancel booking and
view the reserved ticket. An Admin Panel will allow admins to View all
the booked tickets, Add or Remove scheduled trains and Modify/Cancel
a Ticket on User Request.

**1.3) Modules in Project:**

This program has 2 Modules:
User Module:
This module is for user or the passenger to book their ticket, make
payments for ticket directly, modify their ticket, ask for a refund, and
print/generate their ticket.

**Admin Module:**

This module allows admins to View all the booked tickets, Add or
Remove Trains and Modify a ticket or remove it on a passenger’s
request.
  
**1.4) Project Features:**

_**User Module:**_

- _ **Reserve a Ticket:**_ Allows user to Reserve Tickets for available trains on
desirable dates.
- We will be using linked list operations to insert ticket details.
- _**Choose Payment Methods & Pay:**_ Allows user to pay for the
ticket using Credit Card Details.
- We will use simply hard-coded Input/output for this feature as
there is no other way to check Credit Card details i.e. No
Databases used.
- _**Cancel/Refund Booked Tickets**:_ Allows user to Cancel and Refund
yourtickets.
- We will be using linked list to delete ticket details. We will use
searching algorithms to search and delete.
- **_Edit Booked Tickets Personal Details:_** Allows user to Edit
Personal Details from your Booked Ticket. We will use searching
algorithms to search and edit.
We will be using linked list operations to edit ticket details.
- **_Print the Tickets:_** Prints on screen your ticket details for viewing
and printing.
- We will be using linked list operations to display ticket details. We
will use searching algorithms to search and print.
Admin Module:
-  **View All Booked Tickets :** Allows Admin to View All Booked Tickets
saved.
We will be using linked list operations to display all tickets details.
-_ Add or Remove Trains: _Add or Remove Available Trains from
Database.
We will be using linked list operations to display all trains details.
- _**Modify Booked Tickets (based on User Requests):**_Tickets
booked can be modified.
- We will be using linked list operations to edit ticket details.
  
**2.Requirements Specification:**
  
**2.1) Hardware Specifications:**

- Dual Core x86 Processor or above.
- 2GB RAM minimum or above.
- Minimum 20GB Hardware required.
_2.1) Software Specification:_
- Visual Studio 2015
- Microsoft Windows 7 or above required.

**3. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION:**

  _**3.1) INTRODUCTION:**_
  
In this project of Railway Booking Management System, we
implemented the ability to reserve and modify railway tickets.
We used Linked List Operations, Searching & Sorting Algorithms
to modify and display as needed. This project is simple to use
and very user-friendly. It has minimal hardware and software
requirements, and no training is needed for using it.
